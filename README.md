# Swift
A game engine with the aim of making games easy and understandable, whilst still providing powerful abilities to use.
The engine is written in c++ and also uses c++ to run the code.
I am a beginner to game engines, so creating one will be a bumpy ride for me, but i am always open for a challenge.
