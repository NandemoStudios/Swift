# Swift
A game engine with the aim of making games easy and understandable, whilst still providing powerful abilities to use.
The engine is written in python, which means that it is slower than most other game engines, but I am more comfortable using python over other programming languages.
I may in the future rewrite the game engine in a different language so that I can speed the engine up and allow more personalisation out of it.
